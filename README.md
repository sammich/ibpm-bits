# ibpm-bits

This is a repository of IBM BPM/BAW bits I've built. You're welcome to use any of the code, TWX, etc. in your teams, projects. You're welcome to take them and modify/distribute them but I'd love it if you keep references to where it all started.

Most of the items here should have an accompanying link to a blog post of mine.
