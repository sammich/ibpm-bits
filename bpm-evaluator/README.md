# the-evaluator

This is a little tool to let you run code against your BPM server.

![The Evaluator - the hero shot](hero.png?raw=true "The Evaluator - the hero shot")

It's not much more than an eval, but it has some nice features like:

 - autosave
 - a simple JS editor UI
 - control-enter to immediately execute
 - a set of built in business object types ready to use
 - logs to your browser console
